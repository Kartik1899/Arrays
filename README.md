# Arrays
*Array* is a data structure in which elements are stored in continous memory locations. It is of fixed size and
is used to store collection of data which is of same type.
Suppose we have to keep a record of total score in maths of 5 students. Instead of declare 10 different variables,
we can simply declare 1 array, i.e, int marks[5];

### Advantages of Arrays
1. Elements are stored in continous memory location so direct access to any element is possible.
2. Iterating through array is easier as compared to linked list, etc.

### Disadvantages of Arrays
1. It is of fixed size and it cannot be changed.
2. Inserting and deleting elements from array is very costly.
